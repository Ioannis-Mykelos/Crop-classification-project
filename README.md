# Crop-classification-project
Classification with nearest neighbors (k-NN classification).
In the following, we will work with three fundamental data analysis techniques. We will perform classification with the nearest neighbor classifier, a non-linear, non-parametric method for classifica- tion. Then we will apply cross-validation for model selection and standard data normalization for preprocessing.

The data:
The data for the following tasks are taken from a research project financed by Miljfistyrelsen and involving researchers from DIKU and PLEN/KU. Selected results from the project are described by Rasmussen et al. [2016] and Olsen et al. [2017]. While the problem setting is inspired by Olsen et al. [2017], the data were processed differently.
